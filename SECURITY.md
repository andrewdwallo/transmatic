## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority. If you've found a vulnerability in Transmatic, please reach out responsibly. Here's how to report an issue:

### Where to Report
Send detailed information about the vulnerability directly to andrewdwallo@gmail.com. Do not disclose this to the public or any third party.

### Information to Include
Your report should include detailed steps to reproduce, any potential impact, and any additional context that may help in the investigation.

### Expected Response Time
I'll try to get back to you as soon as I see your report, usually within a couple of days. We'll discuss the next steps once I've had a chance to review it.

### Disclosure Policy
Once I've addressed the vulnerability, I'd appreciate it if you allow me to fix it before making it public. If you've reported it, I'll definitely give you credit (unless you want to remain anonymous).

### Feedback Loop
After you've reported a vulnerability:

- We'll chat about it. If I think it's valid, I'll work on a fix. 
- If I believe it's not an issue, I'll explain my reasoning.
- I'll keep you in the loop as I work on a solution.

Thank you for your assistance and understanding. The goal is to ensure the highest level of security for Transmatic.
